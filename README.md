Python Programming Internship Project by CodSoft

Task 1: Password Generator

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement**: 
Design a user-friendly password generator application using Python.

### Requirements
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## Project Description

The Password Generator project is a Python application aimed at generating secure and customizable passwords for users. It utilizes Tkinter, a GUI library in Python, to provide an intuitive user interface for generating passwords with various complexities.

## Features

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - The project includes a graphical user interface built using Tkinter, providing users with an easy-to-use interface to generate passwords.

2. **Password Complexity Options**:
   - Users can select the complexity of the generated password, choosing from options such as low, medium, and high.

3. **Customizable Password Length**:
   - Users can specify the length of the generated password according to their requirements.

4. **Object-Oriented Design**:
   - The project follows the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with separate classes for password generation and GUI functionality.

## Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: 
  - Entry point of the application where the GUI is instantiated and run.

- **`password_creator.py`**: 
  - Contains the `PasswordCreator` class responsible for generating passwords based on user-defined complexity and length.

- **`password_GUI.py`**: 
  - Defines the `PasswordGUI` class, which implements the graphical user interface using Tkinter.

- **`README.md`**: 
  - Documentation file providing an overview of the project, its features, and usage instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run `main.py` to launch the Password Generator application.
4. Use the GUI to customize and generate passwords as per your requirements.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement password strength indicator.
- Add option for saving generated passwords to a file.
- Improve GUI design for better user experience.
